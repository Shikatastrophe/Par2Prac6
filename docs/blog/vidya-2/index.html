    <h1>Death Stranding</h1>

<p>As mentioned in the first entry, my second favourite game is Death Stranding.</p>
<p>I've always been a fan of Hideo Kojima's work, ever since really getting into the Metal Gear Solid franchise with Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater. I really started to get into his franchise with Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, and it also was my first true introduction to open world games. Given all this, I was quite excited when Kojima announced a completely new open world game, set in a vastly different style.</p>
<p>I must admit that the game is a sort of, acquired taste. It is not for everyone, and thus it has gained a reputation as the &quot;delivery guy simulator&quot;, and while that is true, I  think the game is far more than just that. The narrative is compelling, telling the tale of a dying America, and how only the strength, tenacity and will of those called porters keep it together and strong.</p>
<p>Other than the story, the gameplay is not just solid, but also fun and engaging, and the characters you meet along the way are memorable.</p>
<p>In general, this is a game that, if given the chance, will definitely surprise you.</p>
