    <h1>Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys - MCR</h1>
<img align="right" src="/Par2Prac6/static/img/DDTLFK.jpg" width="250" height="auto">
<p>Danger Days was made by the punk rock band My Chemical Romance as their last album. It is a concept album talking about the adventures of &quot;The Killjoys&quot;. The whole album has a Mad-Max-esque vibe to it, with both strong punk lyrics and themes of rebellion and anarchy. This being their fourth and last album, it has a different style being far more upbeat compared to their other works.</p>
<p>My Chemical Romance was founded in 2001 by singer Gerard Way, whom after seeing the horrible attacks of September 11, was prompted to do something with his life, something that felt meaningful to him. After finding a couple of people to form a band with, they went to become one of the most important punk rock bands of the 2000s with albums like &quot;Welcome to the black parade&quot; and &quot;Three Cheers for Sweet revenge&quot;.</p>
<h2>Na Na Na (Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na)</h2>
<p>Na Na Na is the second song on the album, and it was the first single. The song touches on topics like drugs, love, freedom. As far as the story told in the album, these could refer to the control the big evil corporation forces on the people.</p>
<h2>Party Poison</h2>
<p>Named after Gerard's alter ego, Party Poison, the song takes a point-of-view style on his perspective and outlook on life around him. The core message can be about Party Poison's opinion that life is far more serious than so many people think. He thinks most people treat life as a party, when in reality it's anything but.</p>
