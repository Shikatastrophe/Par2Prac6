    <h1>Assassination Classroom</h1>
<img align="right" src="/static/img/AC.jpg" width="250" height="auto">
<p>Assassination classroom has been a staple of who makes me, me. Having watched it at a really early stage in my life, it shaped me to be who I am today. It touches on several topics, and I think most of them are quite important. From not judging a book by its cover, to realising that sometimes someone else might want to live their life through you, the show mixes fun scenarios with a memorable and likeable cast alongside valuable life lessons that have stuck with me for a long while.</p>
<p>Having only two seasons, it is a short watch (at least compared to what is the next anime) and a very much worthwile watch at that. I couldn't recommend the show more, it is brimming with charm, passion and love.</p>
<p>I think the most memorable character is definitely Koro-sensei, the teacher from the class. Using his different anatomy and abilities, he is able to teach his students in a far more different way that, in a way, I think should be the norm.</p>
<p>The message and theme of the world is impecable and the pacing and writing of the entire show is enough to guarantee a watch, and a couple rewatches.</p>
