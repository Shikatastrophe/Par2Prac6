    <h1>Bounce Into The Music - SIAMÉS</h1>
<img align="right" src="/Par2Prac6/static/img/BITM.jpg" width="250" height="auto">
<p>Bounce Into The Music is the debut album for Argentinan rock band SIAMÉS, using a plethora of styles in one album. Released in 2016 under an indie label, this album skyrocketed them into popularity, now being considered one of the most successful indie rock bands of the 2010s</p>
<p>SIAMÉS was founded by Guillermo &quot;Stoltz&quot; Stölzing and Juan Manuel &quot;Blakk&quot; Kokollo in 2013, but wouldn't make it big until 2015 where they started working on Bounce Into The Music. After the smash success of their first album, they worked on &quot;HOME&quot; their second album which was just as, if not more successful than the first. After this, they would release a couple singles and stop for a while, leaving all of us wanting more and more.</p>
<h2>The Wolf</h2>
<p>The Wolf is the first single of the album. The song itself is about addiction, and how the concept of addiction preys on everyone and anyone unsuspecting. While one may attribute it to one kind of addiction the lyrics are made in such a way that anything that someone might find addicting could be considered as such.</p>
<h2>Mr. Fear</h2>
<p>Having a similar &quot;on the nose&quot; approach, this song is about fear and anxiety, the personification of it stalking and harassing the listener. The song is a constant reminder of fear and how it stalks our very selves. But one can find solace in knowing that it can be beaten somewhat.</p>
