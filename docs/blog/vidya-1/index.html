    <h1>Mother 3</h1>
<img align="right" src="/Par2Prac6/static/img/M3.jpg" width="250" height="auto">
<p>For those that know me, most think that Death Stranding is my favourite game, but it may come as a surprise to know it is actually my second favourite, only being able to be trumped by the classic Game Boy Advance game, Mother 3.</p>
<p>Mother 3 has a special place in my heart, since it was one of the first few rpgs I played, and having played Earthbound before that, it was quite a wonderful experience. The amount of charm that is put inside each part of the game is palpable; from the rhythm element of hitting in combat, to the absolute heart wrenching story, the game is sure to be up your alley if you like RPGs. However, the game is also known for never having been released outside Japan.</p>
<p>Shigesato Itoi's work was unfortunately never ported to the US, so the only way to play it is by either getting your hands on an original japanese copy, or by downloading one of the several fan translations that are out there. Either way, the game is really worth a shot and I highly recommend it to anyone that has played any JRPG before, trust me, you won't regret it.</p>
