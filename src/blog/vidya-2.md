As mentioned in the first entry, my second favourite game is Death Stranding. 

I've always been a fan of Hideo Kojima's work, ever since really getting into the Metal Gear Solid franchise with Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater. I really started to get into his franchise with Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, and it also was my first true introduction to open world games. Given all this, I was quite excited when Kojima announced a completely new open world game, set in a vastly different style. 

I must admit that the game is a sort of, acquired taste. It is not for everyone, and thus it has gained a reputation as the "delivery guy simulator", and while that is true, I  think the game is far more than just that. The narrative is compelling, telling the tale of a dying America, and how only the strength, tenacity and will of those called porters keep it together and strong. 

Other than the story, the gameplay is not just solid, but also fun and engaging, and the characters you meet along the way are memorable. 

In general, this is a game that, if given the chance, will definitely surprise you.
