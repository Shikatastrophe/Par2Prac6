ONE is most definitely one of the most successful recent mangakas, making masterpieces such as One Punch Man, Mob Psycho 100 and is now currently working on another manga named VERSUS. However, out of all their work, I think that Mob Psycho 100 is the best out of them all. ONEâ€™s writing philosophy is about the struggles of overpowered people. 

In this case, the story is about Shigeo Kageyama, a middle school student nicknamed Mob. However, he is not your typical student though; he may not have great grades, or great looks, or even some good muscles, but he is the strongest esper in existence. (Espers being people with psychic powers)

However, despite having such a great power at his fingertips, he always tries to never use it, since he is aware of how much power and how destructive he can be if he were reckless with it. 

Mob Psycho is a wonderful example of writing overpowered characters, and still give them a purpose that allows them to shine, grow, and become better as the story progresses. 

There are several memorable characters, such as Reigen, Dimple, and many many more. Mob Psycho 100 is definitely one of the best shows of all time.
